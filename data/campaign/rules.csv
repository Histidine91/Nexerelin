Welcome to the Nexerelin mod for Starsector!

Nexerelin is essentially a 4X extension to the game. Factions within the sector will wage war, create alliances and compete to control a greater share of the sector.

Nexerelin is compatible with a large number of community-made faction mods, which you can add for a more varied gameplay experience.","exerelinNGCIntroNextPage:Next

$isInIntro","SetShortcut exerelinNGCIntroNextPage RETURN
SetShortcut exerelinNGCIntroEnd ESCAPE","Your actions will gain or lose you influence with the factions in the Sector. The higher your influence with a faction, the greater access to their support and technology you will have.

At the start of the game, you pick a faction to join. You are a representative of your chosen faction, and your actions in the Sector will reflect on them. 

You can move to another faction later, if you can earn their trust. You can also choose to go it alone and set up your own empire.","exerelinNGCIntroNextPage:Next
